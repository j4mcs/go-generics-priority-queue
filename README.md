A Go Generics Priority Queue
======

This is an experiment of what a priority queue implementation could look like using Go's [proposed generics](https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-type-parameters.md).

How to run it
------

Copy the code into the Go2 [playground](https://go2goplay.golang.org/) to compile and run. You can also build Go 2 [from source](https://golang.org/doc/install/source) by fetching the `dev.go2go` release tag
